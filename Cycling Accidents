Above is the link for the news article "Wednesday morning peak worst for Canberra cyclists" by The Canberra Times.And I am here gonna explain the mathematical explainations of the  results\conclusion that they have made by the data they collected.
The data they have collected contains the columns [CRASH_ID,CRASH_DATE,	CRASH_TIME,	SEVERITY,	CRASH_TYPE,	CYCLISTS,	CYCLIST_CASUALTIES,	REPORTED_LOCATION,	LATITUDE,	LONGITUDE,	LOCATION_1].
                           "And to note this above data only contains the accident reports that cyclist involved"	                                                                                                                       
CONCLUSION 1  :"The site maps 726 accidents involving cyclists reported to the police since the beginning of 2012, and will be updated as new data is fed in"                 EXPLAINATION 1:By calculating total number of columns we can get Total number of accidents from 2012.And I assume that the data contains the reports of accidents since 2012        [CODE: len(data)]                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
CONCLUSION 2 :"331 crashes caused injuries, and there were two deaths: one at the intersection of Ainslie Avenue and Doonkuna Street in February 2014, and the other in                         Fitzhardinge Crescent in Evatt in September 2012."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    EXPLAINATION 2:First finding how many accidents caused injuries by 'SEVERITY' column.[len(data['SEVERITY']=='injured') assumed that column contains values injured/not injured]                    And we can calculate whether the cyclist dead or not dead by a column 'CYCLIST_CASUALTIES' and the location and date by Reported_Location , Crash_id.                              data[data['CYCLIST_CASUALTIES']=='dead] assumed that cyclist_casuality column contains values dead/alive                
  
CONCLUSION 3 : "Northbourne is a clear black spot, the site of 87 of the reported crashes across the city, or 12 per cent."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        EXPLAINATION3: We can calculate maximum number of reported locatons and the value is the maximum reported crashes in a single[data['REPORTED_LOCATION'].mode()].                                And we can calculate percentage by (number of accidents in Northbourne/total number of accidents)x100.[(len( data[data['REPORTED_LOCATION']=='Northbourne'])/len(data))*100).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
CONCLUSION 4:"Wednesday is the worst day of the week, with about 150 Wednesday crashes reported."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         EXPLAINATION 4:We can create a another column day by dates to find which day the most number of accidents happened.data['Day'].mode()                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
CONCLUSION 5:"Twenty-two per cent of bike accidents occur between 8am and 9am, an hour of trouble that far outstrips any other hour of the day, also the worst time on a Wednesday. Forty-seven of the crashes happened between 8am and 9am on Wednesdays, followed by the same hour on Thursdays (32 crashes)"                                                                                                                                                                                                                   EXPLAINATION 5:We can convert the time to 24 hours(df['time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['time']).dt.strftime('%H:%M'))and then converting it as index.Then we can calculate the number of accidents happened between 8-9 by index.                                                                                                                                                         CODE: data.index=data['time'] 
                        data.index.freq('H')
                        data.between_time('08:00:00', '09:00:00')                                                                                                                                                            
CONCLUSION 6:"The bike crash data show "right-angle collisions" – essentially intersection accidents – are the most common, accounting for 265 of the 726 crashes, or 37 per cent."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              EXPLAINATION6:We calculating how many accidents with "right-angle collisions" by column "crash type" and the location by "reported_location".data[data['CRASH_TYPE']==)"right-angle collisions"].and also find its total[len()].also we can calculate percentage by (len(data[data['CRASH_TYPE']==)"right-angle collisions"])/total number of accidents)x100.                                                                                                                                                                                           
CONCLUSION 7:"Side swipes involving cars and bikes travelling in the same direction are also a common accident, with 111 accidents described as same-direction side swipes.There were 26 rear-end collisions (whether bike to car, car to bike, or even bike to bike is unclear), and two head-on collisions."                                                                                                                                                                                                                           EXPLAINATION 7:We can calculate how many side swipe and rear end collisions accidents by column 'CRASH TYPE'.[len(data[data['CRASH_TYPE']=='side swipe'])] and [len(data[data['CRASH_TYPE']=='rear-end collisions'])
